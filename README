# utility script intended for quickly deploying git version controlled projects 
# in a dev enviroment or can be modified for production
# script may need to be edited to meet your needs
# script assumes user is in www-data or similar group
# script takes a project name and creates a git --bare git repo and web dir with
# hooks to check out working tree into web dir
#
# example
#     sh gitquick.sh project project.git
# the script will create to folders in the directory the script is executed
# project and project.git
# script will also create /var/www/html/project as a mirror
#
# project would be the working dir
# after adding and comminting files in your working dir you can use
#     git push project master or other branch if applies
# after push hooks will check out working branch to /var/www/html/project
# and automaticly update web dir with latest code changes
# --bare is the git bare dir used for tracking the changes of the project
# no working files will reside in this file
# if you want you mirror dir to be different than /var/www/html edit tha path,
# future versions may include a third optional argument for this
